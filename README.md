**I wrote a more complex pure front-end license to protect the copyright of TechUI-Core. Based on TUI-TK, I implemented another license function with simpler logic. The main purpose is not to protect TUI-TK , but only for technical verification.**

For the technical implementation of the pure front-end license, please refer to my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2oeruLJzZMXTRhgo-vxRqsk3sCos6F0) in Mandarin with Chinese and English subtitles.

## üìë License Description

**This repository has a built-in 1-year limited license, which is used for testing and experience, and cannot be used for commercial authorization.**

There are two types of licenses:

- **Term License**
   - Valid for a limited time
- **Permanent License**
   - Once issued, it is valid for life

When generating a license, the authorization scope is specified, such as China or worldwide or other (global scope means no restrictions).

**If the license expires, or if there is no license**, TUI-TK can also run normally. Every time you enter the page, a temporary key will be generated with a validity period of 10 minutes. After the expiration, some components cannot be used normally. At this time, you only need to close the current window and open it again, or clear the sessionStroage and refresh current page.



**Notice! Do not leak license keys on the Internet, otherwise the leaked key will be added to the blacklist in the next TUI-TK release.**
